<h1 id="Geospatial-Analysis-in-Ecological-Engineering">Geospatial Analysis in Ecological Engineering<a class="anchor-link" href="#Geospatial-Analysis-in-Ecological-Engineering"> </a></h1><p>In this section, we introduce basic concepts around spatial analysis and modeling, broadly defined as analyses 
that involves consideration of local, spatially-variant geographies.  We provide examples in Python for 
representing and solving these analyses.</p>
<p>Note that some of methods employed here are defined in the <strong>Tools and Methods</strong> portion of this handbook. 
 Also note that this is a large field and we emphasize below those applications directly relevant to ecological engineers</p>
