<h2 id="Types-of-Engineering-Documentation">Types of Engineering Documentation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Types-of-Engineering-Documentation"> </a></h2><p>From the first meeting with a client where a problem is defined, until the completion of your design process, you will be in frequent communication with your client.  Typically, this takes the form of a series of meetings/design charrettes and engineering memos and reports that provide clients with updates, review alternatives and get feedback and direction as the project proceeds.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Engineering Memos</strong> are generally brief (1-2 pages) and provide summaries of information and request for information from the client. Follow <a href='Engineering-Memos.html'>this link</a> for information on the structure of a typical engineering memo.  An example engineering memo <a href='ExEngMemo.pdf'>is available here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Engineering Reports</strong> are in-depth documents generally addressing more technical aspects of a design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one example of a design process used within Ecological Engineering.  Many variations exist, but all good design processes delineate specific steps in the process and the need to communicate and document the process.  These are general guidelines only; you should adapt these as needed to address specific needs and situations.</p>
<h4 id="Problem-Definition-Memo">Problem Definition Memo<a class="anchor-link" href="#Problem-Definition-Memo"> </a></h4><p>The Problem Definition memo defines the design problem and summarizes background information, and may suggest alternatives for consideration.  Some items typically addressed in this memo are provide below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A concise statement of your understanding of the design problem</li>
<li>A concise statement of your understanding of the overall project goals</li>
<li>A brief summary of similar projects that might provide examples of successful (or problematic) design features, legal, regulatory, economic, and social considerations, and other relevant background information.</li>
<li>A request for additional information/feedback if needed</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h4 id="Requirements-Memo">Requirements Memo<a class="anchor-link" href="#Requirements-Memo"> </a></h4><p>This memo specifies the requirements and specifications for the design problem.  It identifies performance standards the design will need to meet, including legal, regulatory, economic and cultural constraints.  Items typically addressed in this memo are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specific need(s) addressed by the design</li>
<li>Performance standards for the project – what quantitative standards are relevant to the project, and how are they defined</li>
<li>Legal, regulatory, economic and cultural constraints that will or could impact the project</li>
<li>A request for additional information/feedback if needed</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h4 id="Alternatives-and-Feasibility-Memo/Report">Alternatives and Feasibility Memo/Report<a class="anchor-link" href="#Alternatives-and-Feasibility-Memo/Report"> </a></h4><p>This report is often more substantial than a memo, and provides narrative and supporting information outlining one or more design alternatives, with supporting maps, data, photographs, and related information.  Each alternative’s preliminary engineering analysis is presented, and how the design addresses the design goals and meets the design requirements described. Typically, advantages and disadvantages of each design alternative are provided, along with recommendations for moving a single or hybrid design forward.  The report typically includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Background
a.  Site Description providing relevant site characteristics, geotechnical considerations, etc. 
b.  Summary of methods, data sources used to characterize site</li>
<li>Design
a.  Alternatives – rational and summary for each alternative considered.
b.  Summary of Alternative Analysis Methodology
c.  Alternatives Analysis/Matrix
d.  Recommendations</li>
<li>Supporting maps, drawings, documentation</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Preliminary-Design-Memo">Preliminary Design Memo<a class="anchor-link" href="#Preliminary-Design-Memo"> </a></h4><p>The Preliminary Design memo focuses on the preferred design alternative, and presents a summary of a more detailed engineering analysis of the selected design, including an economic assessment.  You are basically proposing a final design alternative for approval by the client, and so sufficient information must be provided in this memo to show how the design meets key performance specifications, reasonable estimates of costs, and any information needed to approve moving the selected alternative into a final design.  This memo will typically include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A very brief review of the alternatives considered.</li>
<li>A presentation of the preferred design alternative, including a rationale and identifying any potential issues the alternative may present</li>
<li>A brief summary of the engineering analysis used in the evaluation.  This should discuss methods and include relevant maps, photographs, and similar background data.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h4 id="Final-Report-and-Design-Documents">Final Report and Design Documents<a class="anchor-link" href="#Final-Report-and-Design-Documents"> </a></h4><p>The Final Report Is provided after all engineering design is completed.  It summarizes the design, describes compliance with requirements and specifications, and provides sufficient detail that the design can be implemented to solve the particular design problem.  All relevant supporting documentation should be included, including maps, photographs, data, and similar information informing the design.  Compliance with all legal, regulatory, economic and social constraints should be documented.  The economic analysis should generally include at a minimum a Return on Investment determination; other economic analyses may be appropriate depending on the project. For many ecological engineering projects, a summary of relevant ecosystem service provision may be included.  In general, the Final Report includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Executive Summary (1 page)</li>
<li>Project Introduction and Problem Specification</li>
<li>Legal, Regulatory, Economic, and Social Context  (including summary of constraints)</li>
<li>Design Alternatives Considered</li>
<li>Preferred Alternative – Rationale, Summary of Performance relative to Specifications</li>
<li>Final Engineering Design, including supporting maps, photographs, data, and similar data.</li>
</ol>
