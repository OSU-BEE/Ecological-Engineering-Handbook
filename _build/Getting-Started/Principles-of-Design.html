<hr></hr><h2 id="Fundamentals">Fundamentals<a class="anchor-link" href="#Fundamentals"> </a></h2><p>Design is fundamental to the practice of ecological engineering.  Below, we provide some guidance on approaching design problems in ecological engineering, including a brief discussion of design process, a stepwise flowchart to identify key steps in the process, and guidelines for documentation produced at various steps in the process.<br>
Design is a creative process that identifies problems and constraints, develops solutions to overcome those constraints and address the problem in a cost-effective way.  These solutions should not only work, they must meet the needs of the client, be based on accepted engineering analyses and methods, consider economic, social, and ethical dimensions of the design, and be communicated to the client in an effective manner.</p>
<p>Ecological engineering designs often incorporate additional constraints related to sustainability, system resilience, and need to provide a variety of ecosystem services, the geospatial nature of many ecological engineering problems, and the intrinsic complexity and variability associated with ecological systems.</p>
<p>The figure to the right provides a nice general summary of the design process, identifying important steps and concepts.  Some of the key steps in this generalize design process are:</p>

<li><strong>Define the Problem</strong>. Clearly state the problem and begin to identify various physical, ecological, economic, legal, social, and ethical constraints.  Research the problem and identify appropriate engineering techniques to analyze possible solutions.  Take a look at other solutions to the problem (or similar challenges) and analyze why they work – or don’t work. Your goal is not to copy others’ work, but to try out different perspectives and gather information on a problem.<br></br></li>
