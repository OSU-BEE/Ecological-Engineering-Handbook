## Fundamentals of Engineering Design

Clearly state the problem and begin to identify various physical, ecological, economic, legal, social, and ethical constraints.

Ecological engineering designs often incorporate additional constraints related to sustainability, system resilience, and need to provide a variety of ecosystem services, the geospatial nature of many ecological engineering problems, and the intrinsic complexity and variability associated with ecological systems.
