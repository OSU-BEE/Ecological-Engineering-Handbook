## Fundamentals of Engineering Design

Design is fundamental to the practice of ecological engineering.  Below, we provide some guidance on approaching design problems in ecological engineering, including a brief discussion of design process, a stepwise flowchart to identify key steps in the process, and guidelines for documentation produced at various steps in the process.

Clearly state the problem and begin to identify various physical, ecological, economic, legal, social, and ethical constraints.

Ecological engineering designs often incorporate additional constraints related to sustainability, system resilience, and need to provide a variety of ecosystem services, the geospatial nature of many ecological engineering problems, and the intrinsic complexity and variability associated with ecological systems.
