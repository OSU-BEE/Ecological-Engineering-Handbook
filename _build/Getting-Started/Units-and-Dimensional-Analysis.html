<p><strong>Dimensional Analysis</strong> is an key engineering technique for insuring that units used in an equation are appropriate and consistent for a given problem. Some important points regarding dimenstional analysis are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dimensional analysis is the process of determining if units used in an equation are consistent and appropriate.</li>
<li>The International System of Units (SI) specifies a set of seven base units from which all other units of measurement are formed. Derived units are based on those seven base units.</li>
<li>Dimensional analysis may involve using conversion factors, which are ratios of related physical quantities expressed in the desired units.</li>
<li>Unit analysis help detemine approporiate conversion factors when using different units to describe an entity of phenomena.</li>
