<p>This section introduces a number of tools for use in Ecological Engineering problem-solving. These tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming (in Python, a simple, widely used, powerful, and free, open-source tool that supports a very broad variety of engineering problem-solving tools and algorithms.  We provide some basics of Python programming, as well as introductions to some very commonly used librairies (packages) available to Python programs.</li>
<li>Data analysis approaches common in Ecological Engineering analyses.</li>
<li>Data visualization techniques in Python</li>
<li>Basics of Modeling, including<ul>
<li>Linear and Nonlinear Regression Analysis</li>
<li>Mechanistic Models in zero, one and two dimensions</li>
<li>Systems Dynamics models for ecological systems analysi</li>
<li>Stochastic Models for representing variability and uncertainty in models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Geospatial Data Manipulation and Analysis</li>
<li>Geospatial Modeling</li>
<li>Life-Cycle Assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, we present both the basic idea of an approach, as well as examples implementing the approach in Python.</p>
