# Geospatial Analysis in Ecological Engineering

In this section, we introduce basic concepts around spatial analysis and modeling, broadly defined as analyses 
that involves consideration of local, spatially-variant geographies.  We provide examples in Python for 
representing and solving these analyses.

Note that some of methods employed here are defined in the **Tools and Methods** portion of this handbook. 
 Also note that this is a large field and we emphasize below those applications directly relevant to ecological engineers

## Topics in this section include:

- Simple Spatial Statistics
- Interpolating Points in a Grid
- Aquifer Analysis
- Flood Modeling
