    "# Culvert Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A culvert conveys surface water through a roadway embankment or away from the highway right-of-way (ROW) or into a channel along the ROW. In addition to the hydraulic function, the culvert must also support construction and highway traffic and earth loads; therefore, culvert design involves both hydraulic and structural design. The hydraulic and structural designs must be such that minimal risks to traffic, property damage, and failure from floods prove the results of good engineering practice and economics. Culverts are considered minor structures, but they are of great importance to adequate drainage and the integrity of the facility. This chapter describes the hydraulic aspects of culvert design, construction and operation of culverts, and makes references to structural aspects only as they are related to the hydraulic design. \n",
