    "# Rainwater Collection System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recipe, we present design strategies for sizing a Rainwater Collection System for capturing and storing rainfall for domestic uses, e.g. graywater or irrigation use.  Rainfall collection systems are diverse and generally require a number of considerations in the design phase.  In the recipe below, we assume a design consisting of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A rooftop collection system\n",
    "* A water storage tank\n",
    "* Appropriate plumbing, filtration, and pumping systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our design strategy presented below focuses on the following strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the rooftop area available for rainwater capture.  This imposes a constraint on the availability of water for storage\n",
    "2. Estimate the water demand that the rainwater collection system can offset\n",
    "3. Estimate cost associated with construction, maintenance and disposal of the system, and associated savings from covering this demand with the collection system\n",
    "4. Determine the most cost effective size configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we assume we are designing a system for Portland, Oregon, for a small apartment building with a flat gravel roof with a surface area of 1800 m2. The design is intend to offset water used for 1) graywater (toilets) and 2) landscape irrigation.  The apartment building houses 60 residents. The area of landscaping to be irrigated by the system is 0.4 ha (4000 m2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Standards for design of rainwater collection systems are currently lacking in the US, but have been developed for other countries, particularly the Portugal (Ref 1), UK (Ref 2), and Germany (Ref 3).  Additionally, a number of articles in peer-reviewed journals address design of these systems.  See the references provided at the bottom of this page for additional information. "

    "## Simplified Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we follow Ref 3 below to size the system. This approach has the advantage of simplicity, but does not consider seasonal variability that can be important if the seasonality of supply and demand are out of phase. This approach involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate rainwater yield based on roof area, type, and annual precipitation\n",
    "2. Estimate demand based on use cases\n",
    "3. Economically optimize the size of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Estimate annual rainwater yield\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate the annual water yield (water available for collection for this system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\large E_R = A_A \\times e \\times h_n \\times \\eta $\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "* $E_R$ is the rainwater yield in liters per year (l/yr)\n",
    "* $A_A$ is the collecting area in square meters (m2)\n",
    "* $e$ is the yield fraction (decimal percent), see table 1 below.\n",
    "* $h_N$ is the quantity of precipitation in liters per square meter (liters/m2, or mm)\n",
    "* $\\eta$ is the hydraulic filter efficiency (0.90 is a typical value)\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of $e$ can be estimated from the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style='fontsize:large'><tr><th>Composition</th><th>Yield Coefficient (percent)</th></tr>\n",

    "\n",
    "For Portland, Oregon, we can get average annual precipitation from a number of sources. From the NOAA website (https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/pqr/pdxclimate/pg133.pdf), we see that the average annual precipitation ($h_N$) is 36.03 inches (915 mm).  Our roof area available for collection is 1800 m2.  From the table above, we choose an $e$ value of 0.6.  We can calculate the annual water yields as follows:  "

To estimate the  maximum storage volume requirement, we need to determine how long we can expect between rainfall events that replenish our storage, and demand during these \"dry\" periods, in other words, how much storage is needed to meet demand during these periods.  Once we have this period, we can size our storage take using the following:\n",
