## Elements of Design for Ecological Engineering

*content under development*

In this section, we introduce concopts and strategies for ecological engineering design.  Design is a central aspect of engineering, and good design practices lead to  designs that are based on accepted standards, are correctly calculated and documented, that reflect various biophysical, economic, and social constraints, and that lead to successful outcomes. 

We start this section with a discussion of the principles of ecological engineering design, followed by concepts around units, dimensional analysis, and critical thinking skills.  We then describe elements of an ecological engineering report - required elements, presentation, computations.  We provide examples of a typical ecological engineering report, as well as a template for developing new reports.
