## Engineering Memos

A typical engineering memo is a 1-5 page document consisting of the following sections:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Header</td><td>Clearly state: 1) who the memo is to, 2) who the memo is from, 3) the date, 4) the specific subject of the memo, and possibly 5) the list of those receiving a copy of the memo</td></tr>

<tr><td>Purpose Paragraph</td><td>The first sentence of the memo should tell the reader the topic of the memo.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>Summary Paragraph(s) [optional]</td><td>For a longer memo, these paragraph(s) can be used to summarize the contents of the entire memo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Discussion Paragraph(s)</td><td>These paragraphs provide the information the reader is expecting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Action or Recommendation</td><td>The final paragraph(s) should provide a closing that is often a recommendation or suggested action for what the reader should do next</td></tr>

</table>

An example engineering memo describing sections of an engineering memo is provided below:
<div style='border:solid;padding:1em'>
    
**MEMORANDUM**

TO: 		Engineering Manager<br/>
FROM: 		Chris Smith<br/>
CC: 		Project manager<br/>
SUBJECT: 	Technical report on new system spec.’s verification<br/>
DATE: 		January 15, 2020<br/>

This is an example of what an engineering memo should look like. It should begin with a very brief introductory statement, like this one. There are two parts to a memo: the heading and the body. 

The heading is important.  Note that there are four items to include in the heading:  Date, To, From and Subject.  You may see memos use the word "RE", which means "in reference to", instead of "SUBJECT". This is a just a matter of preference. The important thing is to make the subject line specific enough so that the reader knows what the memo is about in a glance. For example, "Request for Technical Elective Credit for BEE 529” is a better subject line than just "Undergraduate Petition."  Also, it is standard practice to sign the memo next to your name on the “FROM”  line. 

The body of the memo needs to be clearly written and well organized. You should put each important point in the memo in a separate paragraph. This helps the reader follow what you're doing. The reader will appreciate reading a concise memo, but make sure that it contains the information they need. If there is another document associated with the memo, make sure you refer to it in the memo. Additional information about memo content is contained in the attached document "How to Write a Memo". 

The memo should have a concluding paragraph that includes information about how to contact you. If I may provide additional information, please contact me by phone a 123-456-7890 or by e-mail at me@my.org.
