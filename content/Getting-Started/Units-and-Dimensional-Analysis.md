**Dimensional Analysis** is an key engineering technique for insuring that units used in an equation are appropriate and consistent for a given problem. Some important points regarding dimenstional analysis are:

1. Dimensional analysis is the process of determining if units used in an equation are consistent and appropriate.
2. The International System of Units (SI) specifies a set of seven base units from which all other units of measurement are formed. Derived units are based on those seven base units.
4. Dimensional analysis may involve using conversion factors, which are ratios of related physical quantities expressed in the desired units.
3. Unit analysis help detemine approporiate conversion factors when using different units to describe an entity of phenomena.
