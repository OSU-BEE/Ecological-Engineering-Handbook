This collection of Jupyter Notebooks describe a wide range of problems encountered in the practice of Ecological Engineering.  These notebooks examine both 1) methods of tools used in ecological engineering analysis, and 2) application of the tools to a variety of frequently encountered problem domains in ecological engineering practice.

Example problem solutions are general performed with short Python programs.  We use Python because it is a simple language to understand and learn, Python syntax is cleans, simple, and benefits from availability of wide variety of supporting libraries providing advanced functionality for data handling, data analysis, and engineering computation. Topics are presented through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, which allow interspersing formatted text with Python code and Python-generated output.
