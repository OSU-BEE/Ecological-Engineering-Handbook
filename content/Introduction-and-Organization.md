# Handbook of Ecological Engineering Fundamentals

This collection of Jupyter Notebooks describe a wide range of problems encountered in the practice of Ecological Engineering.  These notebooks examine both 1) methods of tools used in ecological engineering analysis, and 2) application of the tools to a variety of frequently encountered problem domains in ecological engineering practice.

Example problem solutions are general performed with short Python programs.  We use Python because it is a simple language to understand and learn, Python syntax is clean and simple, and availability of supporting libraries providing advanced functionality for data handling, data analysis, and engineering computation. Topics are presented through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, which allow interspersing formatted text with Python code and Python-generated output.

##Topics

This handbook is divided into two primary sections, **Applications** and **Tools**.  The first section, "Applications", focuses on a variety of application domains in Ecological Engineering,   The second section, "Tools", focuses on some basics of Python programming, data management techniques, data analysis and modeling, and geospatial analysis.  see the listing below:

### Tools
- Basics of Python Programming
- Data Management
- Data Analysis, including basics of regression, forecasting, mechanistic modeling, and stochastic modeling
- Geospatial Analysis

### Applications
- Water Resources Engineering
- Geospatial Analysis and Modeling
- Bioprocess Engineering and Resource Recovery
- Ecosystem Restoration Engineering
- Agricultural Systems Engineering
- General Ecological Engineering
