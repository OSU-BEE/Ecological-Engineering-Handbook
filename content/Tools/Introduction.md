# Tools for Ecological Engineering

This section introduces a number of tools for use in Ecological Engineering problem-solving. These tools include:

- Programming (in Python, a simple, widely used, powerful, and free, open-source tool that supports a very broad variety of engineering problem-solving tools and algorithms.  We provide some basics of Python programming, as well as introductions to some very commonly used librairies (packages) available to Python programs.
- Data analysis approaches common in Ecological Engineering analyses.
- Data visualization techniques in Python
- Basics of Modeling, including
	- Linear and Nonlinear Regression Analysis
	- Mechanistic Models in zero, one and two dimensions
	- Systems Dynamics models for ecological systems analysi
	- Stochastic Models for representing variability and uncertainty in models
- Geospatial Data Manipulation and Analysis
- Geospatial Modeling
- Life-Cycle Assessment
 
In all cases, we present both the basic idea of an approach, as well as examples implementing the approach in Python.
