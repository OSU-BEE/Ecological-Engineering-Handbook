This, for example, is a primary mechanism by which most wastewater treatment systems. In our conceptualization, shown below, the biofilm is attached on one side to a surface which is impervious to diffusion, and exposed to a nitrate-containing wastewater on its outer surface. \n",

We will assume the concentration of bacteria in the biofilm is constant and uniform throughout the biofilm thickness. Our governing equation therefore is:\n",

    "In this problem we will examine flow in an aquifer.  Specifically, we will look at a \"plan view\" (as seen from above) of the aquifer, and model the movement of water across the plan view area in response to differences in water height (head) thoughout the aquifer.  Our basic assumption is that water moves in response to gradients in head according to \"diffusion\" (second order) kinetics, with the rate of movement controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the soil.  In this case, \n",
