    "Python programs (and just about any program, for that matter) can be thought of as **recipes** that contain a **a stepwise series of instructions** to acomplish some task. In Python programming, these steps are accomplished by writing down the instructions, in order, using a specific syntax that us understood by the Python interpreter.  The process of **running a program** involves storing these instructions in a text file (with a .py extension) and then asking a Python interpreter to process this file. Much of the process of learning to program involves understanding the specific syntax for the programming language being used.\n",

    "In general, programs deal with data.  This data comes in various forms - things like **strings**, **integer**, **real (floating point) numbers**, but also more complicated objects like **arrays** and **lists** (storing multiple objects), **dataframes** (storing rectangular datasets), **images**, and many others.  Programming languages provide methods for *operating* on this data, like **adding numbers**, computing various mathematical functions, **reading and writing** data, **visualizing data** and many others.  Python provides a rich set of these capabilities, some of which we will explore below.\n",

    "We will start with a traditional first program, printing the string \"Hello World\" to the console.  In Python, this is a simple task, requiring one line of code as shown below.  This very simple program demonstrate a couple of programming concepts: 1) the idea of invoking a *function* (**print**), a \"prepackaged\" functionality, that takes an *argument* and does something with that argument, in this case printing it to the console, and 2) the idea of a *data type*, in this case a **string** consisting of the characters **Hello World**.  Also note that in the *code blocks* below, we provide working python code in the **In[ ]** blocks, and output from the code in the **Out[ ]** blocks. "

The `range()` function ruturns an array of numbers starting with the first argument (1), and continuing up to (but not including) the last argument, in this case, 10, in increments of 1. \n",

    "The following program shows of how Python can be used to address more useful problems, in this case reading a dataset from a website (URL) and generating a visualization of the dataset for display.  It demonstrates the use of high level functions for performing key tasks, and the idea of *importing* prepackaged functionality from Python libraries available to your programs.  This functional is accessed using the **import** statement, which loads functionality from the specified package (library) into your program. In the example below, we **import** a package called **pandas**, a widely used data management and analysis library we will use frequently. We use **pandas** to read a CSV (comma-separated values) file forom disk, print a list of column headers, print the first few records (the *head*) of the dataset, and then plot two of the columns of data, once as time series, followed by a plot of one column against the other."
