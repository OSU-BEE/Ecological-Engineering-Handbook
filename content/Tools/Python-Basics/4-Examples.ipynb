    "Below, we explore some basic Python programs using concepts from this week's class.  These examples are intended to demonstrate defining and using functions in your programs.  Functions provide a way to modularize your program, making reuseable functionality available to your program and simplifying program code.  Additionally, we introduce Pandas, a powerful Python library for reading, writing, manipulating, and analyzing data.\n"
