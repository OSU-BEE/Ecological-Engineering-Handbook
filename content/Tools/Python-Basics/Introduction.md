In this section, we introduce the Python programming language, focusing on understanding basic syntax, packages (libraries) of use in ecological engineering analyses, including reading/writing data, manipulating data, data visualization and numerical analysis and optimization.  We also note that there are numerous Python tutorials on the web - we provide links to some of these at the bottom of this page.
